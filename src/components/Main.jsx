          fiction. As a member of the UCC Mountaineering club, I enjoy the
          physical and mental challenges of bouldering and outdoor climbing. I
          find that the problem-solving skills from climbing translate
          surprisingly well to programming. I also love going to the gym and
          pushing myself hard in each session
